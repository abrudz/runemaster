Note that RuneMaster is work in progress, and not very playable yet.

## Gameplay
- Use arrow keys or numpad or WASD (and QEZC for diagonals) or IJKL (and UOM. for diagonals) to move.
- Move about the map to uncover it and collect coloured rune gems.
- When prompted for an APL expression, either type it or click the rune gems and buttons to insert.
- Closed passages (â›”) turn into doors (ðŸšª) when all required rune gems have been collected.
- Move across the edges of the map to swithc to the next map.
